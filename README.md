Summary:  
I created a twitter clone using Django backend framework and html/css/bootstrap frontend.  
The twitter clone supports multiple twitter features such as a following system, searching by hashtags, liking/unliking tweets, and deleting tweets.  
I chose to include user registration/login system and integration with sqlite database through django.  
I spent about 4-5 hours developing this project.
